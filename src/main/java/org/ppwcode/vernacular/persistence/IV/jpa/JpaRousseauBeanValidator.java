/**
 * <p>This is a JPA entity listener that normalizes and validates {@link RousseauBean} instances immediately
 *   prior to database insertion and update, using {@link RousseauBean#normalize()} and
 *   {@link RousseauBean#wildExceptions()}.</p>
 * <p>Although this a persistence-related issue, this class only depends of the entities implementing
 *   {@link RousseauBean}, and thus can be used in circumstances where you do not wish to apply the
 *   {@code PersistentBean} interface. The listener methods do nothing for entities that not have type
 *   {@link RousseauBean}, so it is no problem to define the listener as the default entity listener for all inserts
 *   and updates. This can be done in the persistence unit definition as follows:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;entity-mappings&gt;
 *     &lt;entity-listeners&gt;
 *       &lt;entity-listeners class=&quot;JpaRousseauBeanValidator&quot;&gt;
 *     &lt;/entity-listeners&gt;
 *   &lt;/entity-mappings&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>In case validation fails ({@code ! }{@link CompoundPropertyException#isEmpty()}), the exception that expresses
 *   the validation problem is packaged into a {@link ApplicationExceptionTransportException}, because JPA entity listener methods
 *   are only allowed to throw {@link RuntimeException RuntimeExceptions}. When a listener does throw an exception,
 *   the current transaction is rolled-back, and all instances of session beans implicated in the current
 *   thread are discarded.</p>
 * <p>The problem with this approach is that, with multiple updates and inserts in 1 transaction, only the
 *   first validation that fails has the opportunity to express its woes.</p>
 * <p>Note that validation using an entity listener only works if certain preconditions are satisfied.
 *   {@link PrePersist} and {@link PreUpdate}. Lifecycle methods operate on not yet fully attached
 *   {@link RousseauBean}s.  If civility checks of a new or updated entity include verifying properties
 *   of associated, already persistent RousseauBeans, then these associated RousseauBeans must be attached
 *   to the {@link javax.persistence.EntityManager}'s Persistence Context prior to calling persist() or merge() for the Entity
 *   that is subject to insertion.  Otherwise, civility checks for the new or updated entity may be performed
 *   using outdated (and therefore possibly incorrect) data;  data needed for civility checks may not be
 *   available if associated {@link RousseauBean}s are not attached, due to lazy fetching.</p>
 *   <p>If you use the {@link JpaStatelessCrudDao} and a persistence strategy (cascade, loading strategy) according to the
 *   ppwcode vernacular for relations, normally all relevant beans are validated before insertion or update. This
 *   validator thus does the same work again. Its functionality is less than optimal in reporting all problems in one
 *   go, but it makes the system completely safe at the cost of extra processing time. This is not a good idea in
 *   systems with an extreme load, but gives us a buffer against programming errors in normal systems, protecting data
 *   integrity. For {@link JpaStatelessCrudDao}, it thus has to make sure that the persistence manager will not try to
 *   persist in cases of problems, since then one problem will be noted twice. Thus {@link JpaStatelessCrudDao} will
 *   have to abort the transaction before commit is attempted. It does.</p>
 * <p>It must be noted that validation is done on the PrePersist and PreUpdate lifeCycle event.  This means that
 *   the entity that is being validated may not have
