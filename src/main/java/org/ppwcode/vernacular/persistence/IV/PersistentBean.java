/**
 * <p>Persistent classes need a primary key. Persistent objects always represent real-world objects,
 *   and therefore should be implemented as {@link RousseauBean}s. This interface enforces the correct
 *   behavior. Supporting code is offered by {@link AbstractPersistentBean}.</p>
 * <p>Users should be aware that this means that there can be more than 1 Java object that represents
 *   the same instance in the persistent storage. To check whether 2 persistent objects represent the
 *   same persistent instance, use {@link #hasSamePersistenceId(PersistentBean)}.</p>
 * <p>Persistent beans are not {@link Cloneable} however. Implementing clone for a semantic inheritance
 *   tree is a large investment, and should not be enforced. Furthermore, it still is a bad idea to make
 *   any semantic object {@link Cloneable}. From experience we know that it is very difficult to decide
 *   in general how deep a clone should go. Persistent beans are {@link Serializable} though, because
 *   they are often used also as Data Transfer Objects in multi-tier applications.</p>
 *<p>{@code _Id_} must be {@link Serializable}, because PersistentBeans are {@link Serializable}
 *   and the {@link #getPersistenceId()} is not {@code transient}. (And BTW, id's must be
 *   {@link Serializable} for Hibernate too ... :-) ).</p>
