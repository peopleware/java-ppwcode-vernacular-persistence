/**
 * <p>Abstraction of how to handle {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}.</p>
 * <p>{@link Dao Dao's} often must deal with potential exceptions from a JDBC driver. These either come from
 *   the driver, the database server, or from exceptions that are raised by triggers or stored procedures,
 *   or by constraint violations. They all turn up as {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}.</p>
 * <p>The first kinds are of an external nature. Normally, this is fatal for an application. According to
 *   ppwcode exception vernacular, they should be encapsulated in an {@link ExternalError}. The latter kinds
 *   are semantic exceptions. Normally, they would result in a roll-back, user feedback, and continuation
 *   of the normal operation of the application. According to ppwcode exception vernacular, they should be
 *   encapsulated in a {@link SemanticException}</p>
 * <p>It is impossible for {@link Dao Dao's} to decide of which kind the {@link SQLException} is in general.
 *   Database exceptions are not much more than a string, and there is no standardization over different
 *   database engines. Furthermore, exceptions raised by triggers and stored procedures, and constraints,
 *   are application specific.</p>
 * <p>Implementations of {@link #handle(SQLException)} should return an {@link InternalException}
 *   that wraps the given {@link SQLException} if they find it of an internal (semantic, persistent) nature. If not,
 *   they should return <code>null</code>. Implementation methods should have no side effects. During this process however,
 *   it is possible that access of the persistent storage is needed (e.g., a case encounter regularly is where
 *   i18n messages for semantic exceptions are defined in tables in the database). If such an access fails,
 *   the method should throw a {@link PersistenceConfigurationError} or a {@link PersistenceExternalError}.</p>
