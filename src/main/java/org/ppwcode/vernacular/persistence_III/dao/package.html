    <h1>Data Access Objects</h1>
    <p>
      <dfn>Data Access Objects</dfn> (<acronym title="Data Access Object">DAO</acronym>) are
      instances that are responsible for interaction with persistent storage in large applications.
      They define more or less complicated creation, retrieval, update and deletion schemes, rooted
      in the business logic of a particular application. The technology through which the persistent
      storage is accessed is isolated from the application business logic.</p>
    <p>Since we cannot define the business logic in this general package, and since the access
      technology differs too, we cannot define much at this high level. {@link
      org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.dao.Dao} is an empty interface that is used mainly as a
      documentation aid, to flag a type as a DAO. In projects, interfaces should be defined that
      extend {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.dao.Dao, with methods that have a technology
      independent contract that describes interaction with persistent storage. The actual
      implementation of these DAO methods will differ and depend on the persistence technology used.
      In this library, classes are offered that offer common support for the implementation of DAO
      classes in a given persistence technology (e.g., JDBC, Hibernate, JDO, EJB, RMI, JPA, ...), which
      actual implementations can extend.</p>
    <p>DAO implementations are almost always stateful, because of the underlying persistence
      technology. Instances should always be dealt with as if they are stateful.</p>
    <p>DAO implementations should be JavaBeans, with a default constructor. Further dependencies
      should be filled out using setters to allow IoC. The technology dependent super classes provide
      this architecture. DAO methods should be allowed to throw a {@link
      org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence_III.PersistenceConfigurationError} if the dependencies are not fulfilled when
      the DAO method is called.</p>
    <p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.dao.Dao} subtypes may dependent on the fact that the
      objects in persistent storage are {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.PersistentBean
      PersistentBeans}, although this will not always be necessary.</p>
    <p>{@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.dao.AsyncCrudDao} gathers standard <acronym
      title="Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete">CRUD</acronym> functionality for {@link
      org.ppwcode.vernacular.persistence.PersistentBean} generically.</p>
