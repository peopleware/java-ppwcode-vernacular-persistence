/**
 * <p>This interface gathers the methods needed for CRUD functionality in an asynchronous context, e.g.,
 *   a web application. Clients will call {@link #createPersistentBean(PersistentBean)},
 *   {@link #updatePersistentBean(PersistentBean)} and
 *   {@link #deletePersistentBean(PersistentBean)} always in the context of a transaction. A transaction
 *   is started by {@link #startTransaction()}, and completes with, either a call to
 *   {@link #commitTransaction()} or {@link #cancelTransaction()}. With this, we
 *   completely dismiss the notion of <dfn>auto-commit</dfn>. In practice, we experience that
 *   an auto-commit feature often leads to confusion for developers, as it is unclear whether
 *   some code is executing in auto-commit mode or not.</p>
 * <p>{@link #retrievePersistentBean(Class, Serializable)} can be called outside a transaction. Objects that
 *   are deleted have their {@link PersistentBean#getPersistenceId()} set to null on
 *   {@link #commitTransaction()}.</p>
 * <p>Before a {@link PersistentBean} is written to the persistent storage (see
 *   {@link #createPersistentBean(PersistentBean)} and {@link #updatePersistentBean(PersistentBean)}, it is
 *   {@link RousseauBean#normalize() normalized} and checked for {@link RousseauBean#isCivilized() civility}.</p>
 * <p>We understand that the limited functionality of this DAO cannot cope with the complete needs of
 *   persistence access. There is e.g., no notion of locking, versioning, etcetera. However, we do know
 *   from experience that this functionality covers a very large part of the needs, and that there are
 *   many applications that need no other functionality than this.</p>
 * <p>In throwing exceptions, we try to make a difference between programming errors, external exceptional
 *   conditions, and internal exceptional conditions. Semantic problems are certainly of the latter nature.
 *   But also the database can signal semantic problems (constraint violations mainly).</p>
