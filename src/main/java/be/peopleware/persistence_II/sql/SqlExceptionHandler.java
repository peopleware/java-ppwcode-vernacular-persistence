/**
 * <p>Abstraction of how to handle {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}
 *   for {@link Dao Dao's}.</p>
 * <p>{@link Dao Dao's} often must deal with potential exceptions
 *   from a JDBC driver. These either come from the driver, the
 *   database server, or from exceptions that are raised by
 *   triggers or stored procedures, or by constraint violations.
 *   They all turn up as {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}.</p>
 * <p>The first kinds are of a technical nature. Normally,
 *   this is fatal for an application. According to ppw standards,
 *   they should be encapsulated in a {@link TechnicalException}.
 *   The latter kinds are semantic exceptions. Normally, they
 *   would result in a rollback, user feedback, and continuation
 *   of the normal operation of the application. According to
 *   ppw standards, they should be encapsulated in a
 *   {@link PropertyException}</p>
 * <p>It is impossible for {@link Dao Dao's} to decide of which
 *   kind the {@link SQLException} is in general. Database exceptions
 *   are not much more than a string, and there is no standardization
 *   over different database engines. Furthermore, exceptions
 *   raised by triggers and stored procedures, and constraints,
 *   are application specific.</p>
 * <p>Specific {@link Dao} implementations can use specific
 *   implementations of this interface to make abstraction of
 *   how to handle {@link SQLException SQLExceptions}.</p>
 * <p>Implementations either should return a {@link PropertyException}
 *   that wraps the given {@link SQLException} if they find it of
 *   a semantic nature. If not, they should return <code>null</code>.
 *   Implementation methods should have no effects.</p>
