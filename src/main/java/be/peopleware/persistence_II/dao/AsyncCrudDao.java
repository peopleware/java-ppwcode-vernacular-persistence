/**
 * <p>This interface gathers the methods needed for CRUD
 *   functionality in an asynchronous context, e.g., a
 *   web application. Clients will call
 *   {@link #createPersistentBean(PersistentBean)},
 *   {@link #updatePersistentBean(PersistentBean)}
 *   and
 *   {@link #deletePersistentBean(PersistentBean)}
 *   always in the context of a transaction. A transaction
 *   is started by
 *   {@link #startTransaction()}, and completes
 *   with, either a call to
 *   {@link #commitTransaction(PersistentBean)}
 *   or {@link #cancelTransaction()}.
 *   {@link #retrievePersistentBean(Long, Class)}
 *   can be called outside a transaction.
 *   Objects that are deleted have their {@link PersistentBean#getId()}
 *   set to null on {@link #commitTransaction(PersistentBean)}.</p>
 * <p>Before a {@link PersistentBean} is written to the persistent
 *   storage (see {@link #createPersistentBean(PersistentBean)}
 *   and {@link #updatePersistentBean(PersistentBean)}, it is
 *   {@link RousseauBean#normalize() normalized} and
 *   checked for {@link RousseauBean#isCivilized() civility}.
